Modularity is a fundamental concept in software design that involves dividing a software system into smaller, independent, and reusable components or modules
   Maintainability:

Modular design promotes code organization and separation of concerns, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Changes or bug fixes can be isolated to specific modules, reducing the risk of introducing unintended side effects in other parts of the system.
Modules can be tested independently, facilitating more focused and efficient testing.


Scalability:

Modular systems are more flexible and can be scaled more easily by adding, removing, or updating individual modules as needed, without disrupting the rest of the system.
Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed in parallel by different teams, allowing for better resource allocation and faster development cycles.
Modules can be reused across different projects or applications, reducing duplication of effort and promoting code reuse.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
   *Unit Testing.  The goal is to verify the correct functionality of each unit in isolation, ensuring that it behaves as expected under various input conditions and edge cases.

   *integration testing.  The goal is to identify issues related to data flow, communication, and dependencies between components.

   *system testing.  System testing is performed on the complete, integrated software system to evaluate its compliance with specified requirements and overall system behavior.
   The goal is to verify that the system meets all functional, non-functional, and business requirements.
   
   *acceptance testing
     Acceptance testing is typically carried out by end-users, stakeholders, or a dedicated testing team to validate that the software meets the intended requirements and is ready for deployment or release.
     The goal is to ensure that the software satisfies the actual needs and expectations of the users or customers.
 Testing is crucial due to various reasons ie:
 Quality assuarance
 Early defect detection
 User satisfaction
 Risk mutigation 
Version Control Systems:
